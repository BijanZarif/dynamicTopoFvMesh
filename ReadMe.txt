Description
    An implementation of parallel, adaptive, simplical remeshing for OpenFOAM.

    The source-tree is separated into several classes for convenience:

     - dynamicTopoFvMesh: Mesh class that extends dynamicFvMesh functionality
                          to handle dynamic simplical meshes, which consist of 
                          triangle prisms in 2D, and tetrahedra in 3D.
                          Adaptation is driven mainly by mesh-quality
                          and mesh refinement criteria.
                          When used in combination with mesh-smoothing
                          methods, this functionality is expected to suit 
                          situations where domain deformation characteristics
                          are not known a-priori.
                          Conservative solution remapping after mesh reconnection
                          is performed automatically.
                          Parallel functionality is also included.

     - fluxCorrector:     Auxiliary library which is used by dynamicTopoFvMesh
                          to perform a correction to velocity fluxes after
                          mesh reconnection.

     - mesquiteMotionSolver: Class that provides a general interface to the
                             Mesquite mesh smoothing library from
                             Sandia National Labs.
                             The class also performs smoothing for surface
                             meshes using a spring-analogy approach, and is
                             known to work in parallel.

     - conservativeMeshToMesh: Conservative mesh-to-mesh interpolation class.

     - mapConservativeFields: Field-mapping utility that works in a manner
                              similar to mapFields in OpenFOAM, using the
                              conservativeMeshToMesh class as a backend.
                              This utility is currently not designed
                              to work in parallel.

Target platform
    The master branch is known to work with OpenFOAM-extend.

    To compile with the OpenFOAM-2.3.x release, switch to the Port-2.3.x branch.
