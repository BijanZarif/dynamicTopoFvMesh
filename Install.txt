Installation instructions:
-------------------------

Pre-installation steps:

 1. Ensure that OpenFOAM is installed and properly configured.

 2. Configure and install Mesquite.

    - Obtain the sources from:
      http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~web1400/1400_download.html

    - Assuming that Mesquite is to be installed in $WM_THIRD_PARTY_DIR,
      define the following environment variables:

      In Bash: export MESQUITE_DIR=$WM_THIRD_PARTY_DIR/mesquite-x.x.x

      In Csh:  setenv MESQUITE_DIR $WM_THIRD_PARTY_DIR/mesquite-x.x.x

      where x.x.x is the appropriate version on Mesquite.

    - Follow installation instructions and compile Mesquite. The following
      configuration is known to work:

          ./configure                     \
              --prefix=$MESQUITE_DIR      \
              --enable-release            \
              --disable-debug-assertions  \
              --disable-igeom             \
              --disable-imesh             \
              --disable-irel              \
              --enable-shared             \
              --without-cppunit           \
              --enable-trap-fpe           \
              --disable-function-timers

      Once configured, proceed with 'make' and 'make install'

    - Set the Mesquite library directory, based on architecture:

        In Bash: export MESQUITE_LIB_DIR=$MESQUITE_DIR/lib

        In Csh:  setenv MESQUITE_LIB_DIR $MESQUITE_DIR/lib

      for 64-bit:

        In Bash: export MESQUITE_LIB_DIR=$MESQUITE_DIR/lib64

        In Csh:  setenv MESQUITE_LIB_DIR $MESQUITE_DIR/lib64

Repository check-out and installation:

 1. Checkout the repository contents to an appropriate location on disk:

    git clone https://github.com/smenon/dynamicTopoFvMesh <check-out directory>

    or, if you're having trouble with the https protocol,
    you can alternatively do it through SSH:

    git clone git@ssh.github.com:smenon/dynamicTopoFvMesh <check-out directory>

 2. Go to the checked-out directory and type:

    ./Allwmake

 3. This will build the relevant libraries / executables, and place them in
    $FOAM_USER_LIBBIN / $FOAM_USER_APPBIN.

Usage:

 1. To use the libraries, add the following lines in your dynamicMeshDict:

    dynamicFvMeshLibs       ("libdynamicTopoFvMesh.so");
    motionSolverLibs        ("libmesquiteMotionSolver.so");
